# Covid-19-India-Data-Analysis

The aim of the project is to provide data analysis of covid-19 (a pandemic that started in December 2019). Through plotting of data, I have studied various cases like most affected countries because of this pandemic.
It contains daily updates on coronavirus cases. We will understand the pandemic from a Spatio-temporal perspective with the data gathered.

Finally, the accuracy of the algorithm has been determined. I have also plotted comparison graphs to analyze how much INDIA is getting affected/recover day by day.
